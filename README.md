# AppleMail.Signiture
A repo for your custom build Apple.Mail signature.

Knowing the basics of software developemnt and how to access commands and controls can take you to some strange places. I had this issue recently trying to create a 'signature' with the Mail App on my Macbook. 

There are various websites that allow you to create signatures that can be added to your signature selector in the App. The problem arrises when you come to import them, however. They never seem to work correctly once imported, be it links broken, styles not working and layout going bananas! üçå 

It took some time, but I figured a way to access the 'signatures' files directly, then import my own custom HTML code for each file, then lock the files so that the text compiler in the Mail App doesn't try to warp the code!

Follow the instructions below to make your own...!
